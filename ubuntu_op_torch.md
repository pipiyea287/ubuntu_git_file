vscode使用jupyter  
  until now, I find that it can be used normally with python=3.7,  torch=1.51, of course it is just served as a kernel or a environment.    
  and if you want to creat one jupyter notebook, pressing 'crtl + shift + P', then input jupyter in the search-box and choose create new jupyter notebook.  
  
  ```python
  a = 5  
  b = a
  ```  
  
 you find in the jupyter, it is working
